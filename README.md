# pr_9_pandasAnalayzer
Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze sales data using Python. This program helps the user to load a dataset from a CSV file, explore the data, perform numerical calculations, handle missing values, generate descriptive statistics, and visualize sales trends using graphs.

This project is suitable for academic practicals such as B.Sc, BCA, Data Science, or Python-based coursework.
